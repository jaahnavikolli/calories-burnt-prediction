Calorie Burnt Prediction Using Machine Learning

📌 Overview
This repository contains a machine learning project designed to predict the number of calories burnt based on various physiological and activity-related features. The project utilizes regression models to make accurate predictions.

📂 Dataset
The dataset consists of multiple attributes related to health and activity, including:
Age
Gender
Height (cm)
Weight (kg)
Duration of Activity (minutes)
Heart Rate (bpm)
Body Temperature (°C)
Calories Burnt (Target Variable)

⚙️ Project Workflow
Data Collection & Processing
Load and preprocess the dataset
Handle missing values and duplicates
